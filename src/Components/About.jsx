          Hey thereðŸ‘‹I delved into the world of coding during my Master's Degree in Audio Engineering back in 2019 where I got my first taste of coding in C++ while working on an audio effect project. Despite creating a cool delay effect that I enjoyed building, Iâ€™ve realised that coding might not be my true calling. This awareness dawned upon me when my teacher emphasized the importance of having a strong grasp of complex mathematics in the programming field.
          <br/><br/>Fast forward two years after finishing my master's, I decided to give coding another shot. I took a free course on learning Python on LinkedIn and thought, "Maybe I'll like this." But, once again, I hit a roadblock with complex math operations when I tried learning Audio Digital Signal Processing in Phyton. 
          <br/><br/>Then, in December 2022, I stumbled upon a mobile app called Mimo, and everything changed. I started learning Front-End Development, covering the basics like loops, if statements, and functions. A month later, I joined their 6-month Front-End Development bootcamp.
          During the bootcamp, I dove into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.<br/><br/>It was awesome! I built a bunch of projects, and six months later, I realised that my love for coding and creating applications bring me joy and satisfaction.
          Since then, I've kept learning and developing my skills as well as developing applications.<br/><br/> So, that's a bit about my coding journey so far. I'm thrilled about the progress I've made, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next chapter. If you're on the lookout for a passionate front-end developer who loves bringing ideas to life, I'm your guy! Let's connect and create something awesome together. Cheers! ðŸš€
